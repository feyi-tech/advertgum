    <section class="mb-10">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-4">How It Works</h3>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        At GoalCards, goals are broken into small “cards,” each representing a specific action or habit to complete. These cards are grouped into packs focused on specific outcomes, such as “Build a Daily Routine” or “Start a YouTube Channel.” You can:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
        <li>Browse and purchase packs created by others.</li>
        <li>Create your own packs and share them with the community.</li>
        <li>Track your completion progress, earn ratings, and leave reviews to help improve packs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        This structure helps you focus on one small task at a time, making it easier to stay consistent and build momentum toward your ultimate goal.
